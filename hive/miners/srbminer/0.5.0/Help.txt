You can mine up to 2 different algorithms at the same time.
Different combinations are available:

- Mine 2 different algorithms on the same GPU
- Mine 2 different algorithms on distinct GPU's
- Mine 2 different algorithms mixed CPU+GPU

If an algorithm can't be mined on a GPU device, it will only be mined on CPU.

There are 4 job handling modes available for you when mining multiple algorithms, and they can be set with parameter '--multi-algorithm-job-mode'

0: no redirect
1: redirect always to a0
2: redirect to next available algorithm
3: work on a1 jobs only when a0 doesn't have anything to work on

Job handling is available both to CPU and GPU mined algorithms.
It is very adviseable to use parameter '--enable-workers-ramp-up', to avoid a potential system crash when all the workers try to allocate their resources at the same time.


What does this do ?

A quick example is the best way to understand :

You set two algorithms to mine, for example algorithm 0 to run on 2 GPU's and algorithm 1 on 4 GPU's.

If for some reason the pool you are mining on algorithm 1 disconnects (and you did not define failover pools), the GPU's that were mining algorithm 1 would now be idling, right?
Well, SRBMiner can take over jobs from algorithm 0 and work on them with those GPU's that would otherwise be idling, until the pool for algorithm 1 becomes available again!

After connecting back to algorithm 1 pool, the 4 GPU's will return back and continue working on jobs for algorithm 1!

Notice:
There is a simple rule for all multi algorithm aware parameters : separate algorithm settings with ';' and things within a specific algorithm with '!'
You can set multi algorithm mining only with cmd parameters, configuration files can set only 1 algorithm.

On Linux you need to escape the ; character with a backslash! ( \; )
When setting any of the parameters don't use " or ' around the value!
Parameters that take a TIME value must be set in SECONDS!

Order of the parameters is important, always put --algorithm as the first parameter!

Example : --cpu-threads 3 --cpu-threads-intensity 1!1!2	[ means worker 0 intensity is 1, worker 1 intensity is 1, worker 2 intensity is 2 ]
Example : --cpu-threads 16 --cpu-threads-intensity 2	[ means apply intensity 2 to all 16 workers ]

Important:
If algorithm is using 2 threads per GPU (auto chosen or  manually set), there is a chance for memory leaking if intensity/raw-intensity value for the second thread is too high.
This can cause system crash, gpu crash or an unstable system!

--gpu-ethash-mode:
1 - No cache on GPU, so there is more space for DAG. Creation time is very slow, but it might extend mining time for a few epochs. Try with 4GB cards where DAG can't fit.
2 - Cache and DAG on GPU. This is the fastest mode. If using with 4GB cards where DAG can't fit, hashing will be very slow.
3 - No cache on GPU, so there is more space for DAG. You need to have at least one 8GB card in the same rig, and 5+ GB system RAM. Creation time is fast. Try with 4GB cards where DAG can't fit.

Pool Parameters:

--pool value                    (pool address:port, separate values with ; and !)

--max-difficulty value          (number, if pool difficulty is above this value miner will reconnect to the pool, separate values with ; and !)
--start-block-height value      (number, start mining when defined block height is reached. Pool must send this info, separate values with ; and !)

If pool name contains 'nicehash' it auto enables nicehash mode
To enable TLS use stratum+tls:// or stratum+ssl:// as a prefix or set with --tls parameter
When defining pools use '!' to define failover pools
