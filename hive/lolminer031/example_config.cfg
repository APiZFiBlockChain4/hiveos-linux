### User based configuration
--server eu.minexpool.nl                              # Insert the pool address here
--port 9999                                           # Insert your pool port here
--user XQZoBeGPZJoLhTdkcF8bScsNH5Wyesd9g4.worker0     # Insert your user and worker names here
--pass x                                              # Insert your worker password here

					
### Device configuration 
--platform AUTO                       # Insert the index of the platform you want to run on. Run lolMiner-mnx.exe --list-devices
                                      # to see all available platforms and the available devices for each platform
--device ALLGPU                       # Insert your devices to run the miner here. For multiple GPU pass a comma separated list, e.g.: 0,1 for using two GPUs  

#--set-work-batch 2G                  # Uncommend this line to set the work batch size. Higher values increase GPU memory use of lolMiner-mnx. 
                                      # See lolMiner_readme.pdf for details.


### Display log configuration
#--set-short-stats-interval 5         # Uncommend to set the time interval (seconds) between the short term performance output. Set 0 to disable the output. 	
#--set-long-stats-interval 60         # Uncommend to set the time interval (seconds) between the long term performance output. Set 0 to disable the output.
                                      # The value will also determine the length of the benchmark mode
#--enable-time-print                  # Uncommend to allow lolMiner-mnx to print the system time in HH:MM:SS format before each performance output.



### Expert parameters - handle with care
#--use-alt-mine-thread                # Enables the mine thread handling of lolMiner-mnx 0.13. This will disable multi-GPU support.
                                      # Therefore only the first number in --device is handled. The Nvidia load hotfix is enabled by default.
				      # Currently Intel devices are only working with this switch enabled.

#--set-sleep-duration 1000            # Sets the time span between polling the GPUs for completed work in microseconds. Lower values may stabilize
                                      # the performance, but also increase CPU load for all vendors. Setting the value to 0 will make lolMiner-mnx use one full
                                      # CPU core by 100% for handling all devices. If this is used with "--use-alt-mine-thread" it will disable the Nvidia hotfix.
                                      # Higher values reduce CPU load but may reduce hash speed. Default is 1000 microseconds = 1 millisecond.
