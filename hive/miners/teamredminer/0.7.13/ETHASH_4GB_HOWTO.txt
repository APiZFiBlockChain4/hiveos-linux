TeamRedMiner Ethash 4GB Status
==============================

v1.0 - 2020-10-04 - First version, Windows only.

Summary
-------
Both major coins on ethash, ETH and ETC, are approaching the hard
limit where 4GB GPUs will no longer be able to hold the DAG necessary
to perform max hashrate hashing. ETC is 11 epochs ahead of ETH,
meaning it's already impossible to mine on Windows, and only has a few
epochs left on Linux before it's impossible.

This status document contains instructions on how to maximize the life
span of your 4GB gpus when mining with TRM. This document will be
updated continuously between TRM releases up until epoch 380.

Windows

Windows overall comments
------------------------
- All our tests have been mode on driver Adrenalin 20.4.2. Many other
  driver versions will work equally well, we chose to lock down
  testing to a single version.

- Older drivers consume more baseline vram and will not work. You need
  to use a recent driver like Adrenalin 20.4.2 that we use for
  testing.

- This guide and testing applies to gpus _without_ monitor(s)
  connected. At this point, there simply isn't enough vram on the gpu
  to both store the DAG and drive graphics.

Windows TL;DR
--------------------
We now provide two new example .bat files, start_eth_4gb.bat and
test_eth_4gb_epoch_374.bat. If you can run the test and cards reach
their max speed, you're good to go for epoch 374 but need to add
"--restart_gpus --uac --eth_alloc_epoch=374" as additional arguments
to your current command line. The start_eth_4gb.bat contains these
arguments. You will also need TRM v0.7.13 or later. If you don't reach
the same hashrates as you normally do, or if you don't like the
built-in gpu reset mechanism, continue to read below.

Windows instructions
--------------------
1) RESET gpus right before starting the miner. The allocation is very
   sensitive. Even coming from a fresh reboot isn't enough for some
   gpus. Starting with TRM v0.7.13, we include experimental support
   for automatically resetting gpus before mining. This maximizes the
   probability of Windows allowing the large DAG allocation.

   NOTE: the gpu reset is optional, but our example .bat files do
   it. You can test without the "--restart_gpus" option, and if it
   works fine without it, good for you! If you do need to reset gpus,
   you have four options:

   a) If you run the miner as Administrator, you can add
      "--restart_gpus" as a miner argument and it will automatically
      restart your gpus without requiring user interaction. Configured
      clocks will be retained, at least this has been the case in all
      our tests, so you typically run your clock configuration as
      usual before starting the miner.
   
   b) Run the miner as a normal user and add "--restart_gpus --uac"
      to your start command line. This will trigger a privilege
      escalation at startup, and the standard Windows popup asking if
      you accept running this program as Administrator. Only the
      separate process that resets the gpus will run with admin
      rights, the miner will then run as the normal user.
   
   c) Do your own reset of the necessary gpus with some tool,
      e.g. "devcon.exe" available in the Windows Driver Kit
      toolset. You need to google for instructions on how to use the
      tool. This mechanism was very common in the early Vega Monero
      mining days.

   d) Disable+enable all gpus manually in the Windows Device
      Manager. Not really recommended for anything but testing.

2) ALWAYS add the argument "--eth_alloc_epoch=N". We believe most (or
   all?) rigs should be able to do epoch 374, which means using
   "--eth_alloc_epoch=374". If this doesn't work, as in you're not
   getting your normal max hashrates, try a lower number. This
   argument forces the miner to allocate the necessary vram on all
   gpus right at startup in a prioritized way, and ensure no DAG
   reallocations will be made until epoch 375.

3) TEST your max possible epoch on beforehand. This is done by running
   the miner in benchmark mode using "--eth_epoch=374". You just add
   this argument last in your normal start command line with pool,
   wallet etc. This mining mode will NOT submit any shares to your
   pool, it's only for benchmarking. As soon as you see if you're
   reaching max speed or not, exit the miner and remove the argument
   from your start command.

   NOTE: we also provide an example .bat file for this test,
   test_eth_4gb_epoch_374.bat included in the zip package.

4) ADVANCED mode: for some rigs, the default allocation strategy isn't
   optimal. We provide a tweak argument that might help for such rigs.
   The argument is called "--eth_4g_alloc_adjust=X,Y,...". This is the
   description from our --help output:

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   --eth_4g_alloc_adjust=X,Y,...

   On Windows, the allocation balance is very delicate for 4GB gpus
   being able to reach their maximum possible DAG epoch.  The miner
   uses a strategy that has worked fine for our test gpus, but other
   setups can benefit from tweaking this number.  The valid range is
   [-128,+128].  Zero means no adjustment.  You provide either a
   single value that is used for all 4GB gpus in the rig, or a
   comma-separated list with values for all gpus, including non-4GB
   Polaris gpus.  Values for non-4GB gpus are ignored.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   I would recommended testing values between -16 and 16. I do not
   believe values outside that range will be helpful. If you do find
   that this is helpful for you, please drop us a note in our Discord,
   it's very interesting to hear if there are rigs out there only
   being able to do epoch 374 with a manual adjustment using this
   argument.

5) Epoch 375 is here or I can't reach the same speed on the current
   epoch, what do I do if I want to continue mining?

   Your first choice is to switch to Linux. Epoch 380 should be doable
   on most drivers, and all major mining os distributions will make
   sure they are capable of mining the max possible epoch.

   Your second choice is to switch to a different coin using ethash
   but with a lower algo. Metaverse, Expanse, Ubiq are three examples,
   but their returns will be much lower then ETH.

   Your third choice is to switch algo. Plenty of choices available,
   although the power draw profile for e.g. kawpow is very different
   from ethash. You have to do your own research for making an
   informed choice here.

=========================================================================
Linux
=========================================================================

This section will be written shortly - Linux drivers in headless mode
should be able to do epoch 380, we will get another version out there
before this happens.

Happy mining!
