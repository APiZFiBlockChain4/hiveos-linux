Team Red Miner Nimiq Mining
============================
This document provides some quick pointers on how to best test and
tune for the Nimiq argon2 variant.

Pools
-----
TRM only support Nimiq dumb mode mining, and not over secure
websockets but plain tcp. At the time of writing, no pools support
this variant. Therefore, we have a separate proxy project that is
needed here:

https://github.com/Kerney666/trm_nimiq_proxy

We also provide a proxy at 18.196.209.223:4444 connecting to
nimiq.icemining.ca for easy testing. See our example scripts.

Use the --nimiq_worker=myrig argument to set a device name for your
workers that is passed to the pool(s).


Tuning
------
Nimiq tuning is more or less identical to Turtlecoin Chukwa
tuning. See our separate tuning guide TRTL_CHUKWA_TUNING.txt.


Nimiq Tuning Parameters
-----------------------
There are no tuning parameters for Nimiq, it just runs. Play with your
clocks to adjust behavior and power draw.
