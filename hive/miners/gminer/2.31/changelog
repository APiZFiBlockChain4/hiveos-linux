Gminer v2.31
* fixed bug due miner sent stale shares on all algorithms (this fix should significantly decrease stale share percentage on all algorithms)
* implemented unique mechanism that minimize stale shares on Ethash/Etchash algorithm (~+1% accepted shares to total accepted share count)
* significant performance improvement for Ethash/Etchash algorithm on AMD cards in OC mode

Note:
Remember GMiner supports Ethash/Etchash algorithms on Nvidia and AMD cards
Supports ETC hardfork (use --algo etchash for auto-switch)
