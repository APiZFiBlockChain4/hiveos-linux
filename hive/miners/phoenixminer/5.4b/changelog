PhoenixMiner 5.4b
* new kernels for AMD Vega and Navi GPUs that are slightly faster when the DAG buffer is approaching 
  or passing 4GB in size (the current ETH DAG is close to 4GB). To use these new kernels, you need to use drivers 20.10+ or later.
* re-running auto-tune as needed when switching to a different DAG buffer type (e.g. when switching from ETH to ETC, or back)
* other small fixes and improvements
